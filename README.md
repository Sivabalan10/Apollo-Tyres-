# Apollo Tyres: Conveyor Tire Jam Prediction

## Project Overview

Our project at Apollo Tyres leverages advanced technologies to predict and prevent tire jams, thereby minimizing downtime and enhancing operational efficiency. This unique blend of machine learning, computer vision, and automation techniques is seamlessly integrated into Apollo Tyres' operations.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks, including tire detection and monitoring.
- **Tkinter**: For developing a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the system.
- **SQLite**: For efficient data storage and management.
- **PLC Integration**: For seamless automation and control within the manufacturing environment.

## Features

1. **Tire Jam Prediction**: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to predict potential tire jams before they occur.
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of tire movement to ensure smooth operations.
3. **Data Storage**: Efficiently stores data related to tire movements, jams, and other critical parameters in an SQLite database.
4. **User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI developed using Tkinter for easy interaction with the system.
5. **Automation Control**: Integrates with PLCs to automate responses to detected tire jams, minimizing downtime.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
